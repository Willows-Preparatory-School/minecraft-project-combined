# Minecraft-Project
The template for GitHub classroom for the open-ended project submissions.

Submit your files with thorough documentation. Don't forget to register your changes in the corresponding module class (included in this comment). Don't add unnecessary files from the labs; solely add your summative concepts and their registration.
